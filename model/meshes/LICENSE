The original hand meshes (*.stl) were generated by Joerg Schmit and are available
from GrabCAD: https://grabcad.com/library/human-left-hand.
There is no explicit license but a comment of the author on that page makes them usable but not to sell:
  "Joerg Schmit 11 Sep 2013 12:33 PM  : Hello Justin, no problem - the model is here for use. It is only not allowed to sell the model.  Jörg."

Guillaume Walck <gwalck@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de> modified the meshes with Blender and generated the meshes in the taxels folder.
